# PORTFOLIO
## Personal Website
 
I built my portfolio using **Node.js** and the **Express framework**, with **Firebase** serving as the database. The project was designed to showcase my web development skills and features a sleek, modern design with intuitive navigation. I utilized various front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user interface. The integration with Firebase allowed for efficient data storage and retrieval, as well as real-time updates for dynamic content. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in back-end development, database management, and API integration.
